The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

- Relevant log lines:
  - Build command run: [line 62](#L62) — [line 64](#L64)
  - The failing command output: [line 65](#L65) ("tsx: not found")
  - Exit code and failure summary: [line 71](#L71) and [line 97](#L97)

Diagnosis
- Error type: missing executable / dependency at build time.
- Cause: The build script runs "tsx script/build.ts" (see [line 64](#L64)), but the tsx binary is not available in the build environment (see [line 65](#L65)). That means tsx is not installed (or not installed where Netlify can find it) when Netlify runs npm run build.

Solution
1) Verify whether tsx is declared in package.json (and that package.json was committed)
   - Open your repo package.json: https://github.com/CpmJhon21/OptiLink-Replicate-by-jhon/blob/main/package.json
   - Check that there is either a dependency or devDependency entry for "tsx" and that the "build" script indeed uses tsx.

2) If tsx is missing, add it as a devDependency and commit the lockfile:
   - Locally run:
```bash
npm install --save-dev tsx
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "chore: add tsx devDependency for build"
git push
```
   - This ensures Netlify installs tsx during the build and the tsx CLI will be available for npm run build.

3) If tsx is already listed but the build still fails:
   - Ensure package.json and lockfile are committed and pushed.
   - Clear Netlify cache and re-trigger a deploy (Netlify normally installs devDependencies during build; stale cache or missing lockfile can cause the binary to be absent).

4) Quick alternative (temporary) workaround:
   - Change your build script to use npx so Netlify will fetch tsx at run-time (not recommended as permanent fix):
```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "npx tsx script/build.ts"
}
```
   - Commit and push the change and redeploy.

After applying the fix, trigger a new Netlify deploy. The original failure (exit code 127) was due to the missing tsx binary called by the build script (see [line 65](#L65) and [line 71](#L71)).
