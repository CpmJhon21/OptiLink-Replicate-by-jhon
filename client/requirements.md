## Packages
framer-motion | Smooth animations for sidebar and accordions
lucide-react | Icons for the UI (already in base, but emphasizing use)
clsx | Utility for conditional classes (standard)
tailwind-merge | Utility for merging tailwind classes (standard)
prismjs | Syntax highlighting for code examples

## Notes
The app simulates an API documentation site.
The main layout is responsive: fixed sidebar on desktop, drawer on mobile.
The theme is dark mode by default with neon green accents.
No real backend API exists for the "Try it out" buttons in this demo, but the UI should simulate the interaction or just show the request structure.
